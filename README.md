Game - Connect Four 

- Connect Four is a classic two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.
- The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column.
- The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
- The game ends in a draw if the board is filled completely without any player connecting four in a row.

It's a fun and strategic game that has been popular for decades and is often used as a simple introduction to game theory and strategic thinking.
